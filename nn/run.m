%  Instructions
%  ------------
% 
%  This file contains code that helps you get started on the
%  linear exercise. You will need to complete the following functions 
%  in this exericse:
%
%     sigmoidGradient.m
%     randInitializeWeights.m
%     nnCostFunction.m
%
%  For this exercise, you will not need to change any code in this file,
%  or any other files other than those mentioned above.

%% Initialization
clear ; close all; clc

%% Setup the parameters you will use for this exercise
input_layer_size  = 400;  % 20x20 Input Images of Digits
hidden_layer_size = [50 25];   % 25 hidden units
num_labels = 10;          % 10 labels, from 1 to 10   
                          % (note that we have mapped "0" to label 10)

%% =========== Part 1: Loading and Visualizing Data =============
%  We start the exercise by first loading and visualizing the dataset. 
%  You will be working with a dataset that contains handwritten digits.
%

% Load Training Data
fprintf('Loading and Visualizing Data ...\n')

load('ex4data1.mat');
m = size(X, 1);

% Randomly select 100 data points to display
sel = randperm(size(X, 1));
sel = sel(1:100);

displayData(X(sel, :));

fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;


%% ================ Part 6: Initializing Pameters ================
%  In this part of the exercise, you will be starting to implment a two
%  layer neural network that classifies digits. You will start by
%  implementing a function to initialize the weights of the neural network
%  (randInitializeWeights.m)

fprintf('\nInitializing Neural Network Parameters ...\n')

num_hidden_layers = size(hidden_layer_size, 2);
initial_Theta = cell(num_hidden_layers, 1);
initial_nn_params = [];

for i = 1 : num_hidden_layers
  if 1 == i
    input_size = input_layer_size;
  else
    input_size = hidden_layer_size(1, i);
  end
  if num_hidden_layers == i
    output_size = num_labels
  else
    output_size = hidden_layer_size(1, i + 1);
  end
  initial_Theta{i} = randInitializeWeights(input_size, output_size);

  % Unroll parameters
  initial_nn_params = [initial_nn_params; initial_Theta{i}(:)];
end


%% =============== Part 7: Implement Backpropagation ===============
%  Once your cost matches up with ours, you should proceed to implement the
%  backpropagation algorithm for the neural network. You should add to the
%  code you've written in nnCostFunction.m to return the partial
%  derivatives of the parameters.
%
fprintf('\nChecking Backpropagation... \n');

%  Check gradients by running checkNNGradients
checkNNGradients;

fprintf('\nProgram paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;


%% =============== Part 8: Implement Regularization ===============
%  Once your backpropagation implementation is correct, you should now
%  continue to implement the regularization with the cost and gradient.
%

fprintf('\nChecking Backpropagation (w/ Regularization) ... \n')

%  Check gradients by running checkNNGradients
lambda = 3;
checkNNGradients(lambda);

nn_params = initial_nn_params;
% Also output the costFunction debugging values
debug_J  = nnCostFunction(nn_params, input_layer_size, ...
                          hidden_layer_size, num_labels, X, y, lambda);

fprintf(['\n\nCost at (fixed) debugging parameters (w/ lambda = 10): %f ' ...
         '\n(this value should be about 0.576051)\n\n'], debug_J);

fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;


%% =================== Part 8: Training NN ===================
%  You have now implemented all the code necessary to train a neural 
%  network. To train your neural network, we will now use "fmincg", which
%  is a function which works similarly to "fminunc". Recall that these
%  advanced optimizers are able to train our cost functions efficiently as
%  long as we provide them with the gradient computations.
%
fprintf('\nTraining Neural Network... \n')

%  After you have completed the assignment, change the MaxIter to a larger
%  value to see how more training helps.
options = optimset('MaxIter', 50);

%  You should also try different values of lambda
lambda = 1;

% Create "short hand" for the cost function to be minimized
costFunction = @(p) nnCostFunction(p, ...
                                   input_layer_size, ...
                                   hidden_layer_size, ...
                                   num_labels, X, y, lambda);

% Now, costFunction is a function that takes in only one argument (the
% neural network parameters)
[nn_params, cost] = fmincg(costFunction, initial_nn_params, options);

% Obtain Theta1 and Theta2 back from nn_params
num_hidden_layers = size(hidden_layer_size, 2);
Theta = cell(num_hidden_layers, 1);
pos = 0;
for i = 1 : num_hidden_layers
  if 1 == i
    input_size = input_layer_size;
  else
    input_size = hidden_layer_size(1, i);
  end
  if num_hidden_layers == i
    output_size = num_labels;
  else
    output_size = hidden_layer_size(1, i + 1);
  end
  Theta{i} = reshape(nn_params(pos + 1 : pos + output_size * (input_size + 1)), ...
                     output_size, (input_size + 1));
  pos = pos + output_size * (input_size + 1);
end

fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;


%% ================= Part 9: Visualize Weights =================
%  You can now "visualize" what the neural network is learning by 
%  displaying the hidden units to see what features they are capturing in 
%  the data.

fprintf('\nVisualizing Neural Network... \n')

displayData(Theta{1}(:, 2:end));

fprintf('\nProgram paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;

%% ================= Part 10: Implement Predict =================
%  After training the neural network, we would like to use it to predict
%  the labels. You will now implement the "predict" function to use the
%  neural network to predict the labels of the training set. This lets
%  you compute the training set accuracy.

pred = predict(Theta1, Theta2, X);

fprintf('\nTraining Set Accuracy: %f\n', mean(double(pred == y)) * 100);
